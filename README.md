# English Premier League 23/24 Insights

## Overview

This mini project aims to do some basic EDA of 23/24 season's statistics and hopes to use some ML regression methods to predict next season's outcome (although we all know that my beloved manchester city and pep guardiola will take its/his 5th PL in a row but lets still do this)
